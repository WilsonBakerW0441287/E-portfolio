                the hard part about writing a computer program isnt trying to be as smart as the computer, its hard to
                learn how to be as mind numbingly STUPID as a computer, until you understand that you'll never REALLY be
                able to write programs!" - Andy Harris 2016

                this is my favorite quote from a programmer. It's from a video "how to think like a programmer"
                I discovered the video soon before my time at NSCC and I would agree! You need to be able to problem solve but You can't do anything if you can't type in a language and the languages are so literal that you have to take a step back and write it in a way the computer will understand.

                My name's <span class="name">Wilson Baker </span>, I go to NSCC for IT programming, spend lots of quality time with my girlfriend or family, and casually play video games. My father <span class="name"> Doug baker </span> has worked at eastlink for about 20 years now. So from a very early age I was introduced to computers and games.

                Because of this introduction I have always been very interested computers, when my dad first showed me a little bit of html when I was in jr.High it was the coolest thing I had ever seen! I kept up with coding throughout highschool, never learned very much but was taught the basics of python by 3 different teachers which was a huge step up when I got to nscc and our first course was python. I had never learned more than the basics because I didn't see how applicable it was going to be for me. I always have known that I wanted to work with computers so I have tried to keep in know with current technologies.

                The 'MetaVerse' that has been recently created gives me a lot of hope for the new way of traversing the internet. If you've read or seen 'Ready Player One' you know exactly why I have hope. It shows us a dystopian future where everyone lives in this Virtual universe, where you can take the car you were just driving in rocket leauge and drive it into your GTA garage, a world where everything is connected.
