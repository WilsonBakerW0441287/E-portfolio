                the hard part about writing a computer program isnt trying to be as smart as the computer, its hard to
                learn how to be as mind numbingly STUPID as a computer, until you understand that you'll never REALLY be
                able to write programs!" - Andy Harris 2016

                this is my favorite quote from a programmer. It's from a video "how to think like a programmer"
                I discovered the video soon before my time at NSCC and I would agree! You need to be able to problem solve but You can't do anything if you can't type in a language and the languages are so basic that you have to take a step back and write it in a way the computer will understand.
