                "What's the difference a shoe and a computer?
                It's a tie!
                the hard part about writing a computer program isnt trying to be as smart as the computer, its hard to
                learn how to be as mind numbingly STUPID as a computer, until you understand that you'll never REALLY be
                able to write programs!" - Quote from Andy Harris 2016, It's from a video "How to think like a programmer"

                About me: I am a 20 year old student at Nova Scotia Community College, I am currently enrolled in the
                IT programming program. I am a very hard working person, I am always willing to learn new things and
                improve my skills. I am a very social person, I love to meet new people and make new friends.
                I am a very creative person, I will find ways to solve problems that most people don't.
                My father <span class="name">Doug baker </span> has worked at eastlink for over 20 years.
                So from a very early age I was introduced to computers and games and I have been hooked ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of this I have always been very interested computers, when my dad first showed me how to make a button in HTML 
                when I was in jr.High it was the coolest thing I had ever seen! I kept up with coding
                throughout highschool, learning python in a class and then learning more on my own though online coding courses. 
                I had never learned more than the basics because I didn't understand how applicable it was going to be for me. I always
                have known that I wanted to work with computers so I have tried to keep up with current technologies by subcribing to news letters that keep me informed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been interested in VR and AR, I have been following the development of VR for a few years and I am very excited to see where it goes.
